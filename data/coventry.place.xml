            <p>there are several theories as to what the name means; it's thought that the most likely meaning is 'Coffa's tree' [--] a tree planted by or named after a person called 'Coffa', which may have marked the centre or boundary of a settlement</p>
            <p>an alternative theory is that the name comes from 'Coventre' [--] from coven, an old variation of 'convent', and tre, a Celtic word meaning 'town'</p>
